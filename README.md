# Segmentation Framework 
This framework is a generic wrapper on top of [segmentation-models](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models) intended to tackle any type of image segmentation tasks.
As the biggest challenge in almost the segmentation problem nowadays is the quality of the dataset. 
We believe in giving more focus on pre-processing can make a great difference.
This doesn't mean that we jump over some stages within the model building pipeline.
